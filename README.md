# Medical Text Classification Project

A data mining project to develop a predictive model (specifically a k-NN classifier) that can determine, given a medical abstract, which of 5 classes (medical conditions) it falls in. The 5 classes are diseases: **digestive system diseases**, **cardiovascular diseases**, **neoplasms**, **nervous system diseases**, and **general pathological conditions**

**Note:** This is a graduate assignment for CMPE 255 Data Mining course at SJSU (under Professor David Anastasiu).
